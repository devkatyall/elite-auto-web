      description: "Amazing crew! At first, I was being doubtful of picking but then I was taken away by their professionalism throughout the process. These boys are serious about what they do, they made sure that they delivered what I was looking for even if it took them extra time- well to be real I should have been more clear with my words. Totally worth the money, see you guys around in Durham Region üòâ"
